This assignment will help you practice adding CSS styles to elements created in Javascript.

1. Create a new project with an HTML file, a linked JS file, and a linked CSS file.
2. In the JS file, create a list of 5 H2 elements on the DOM using a for loop (Hint: this was covered in the previous assignment). 
Give them whatever text you would like.
3. Using the .style property, edit the elementâ€™s styles in your js to have:

    Font-size: 20px
    Font-weight: lighter
    Font-family: sans-serif
    Color: cornflowerblue

    4. Go to your CSS file and create a class called .border that has:

    2px solid black border,
    5px padding
    5px margin

5. Back in your JS, add that class to the elements being created using classList.
