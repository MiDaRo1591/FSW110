        <script scr='w1index.js'> </script>
    </head>

    <body> 
        <script scr="JavaScript.js"></script>
        <nav>This is the navigation bar. It dose nothing though...</nav>
        <h1>This is the H1 Tag</h1>   
        <p>This is for a paragraph to be added to the websight so I'm just making a big long ramble at this point in hopes that it shows up the way that it is suposed to be. </p>                                              
        
        <ul>I need to have a list in here.</ul>
            <li>It dosn't say if it's ordered or not.</li>
            <li>So I'm going to do both.</li>
            <li>This list is unorganized.</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>This is the second list.</ol>
            <li>This one is organized.</li>
            <li>It uses OL instead of LI.</li>
            <li>It should look nicer.</li>
        </ol>
