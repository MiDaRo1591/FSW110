For this project, you will create a basic website where all the elements are created using only JavaScript.  

Requirements:

No css styling required
Must link a JS file to HTML file
Site must have:
a navbar with links (doesn’t need to work)
An h1 tag
A p tag
A list
Footer
You will append created elements to the body tag of your html 
page to produce the entire site, so the only HTML tag they will 
add to your HTML page is the script tag.
