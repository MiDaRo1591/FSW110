It is important to note that any button placed inside of <form> tags will automatically fire a “submit” 
event for the form to capture and use. Your task for this assignment is to create a form on an html file 
that has at least 3 inputs and a button.

When the button is clicked, the inputs should be displayed in an “alert” window using the alert() method.  
After the alert is closed, the inputs should clear themselves out.

            2 in jsc, select button, eventlistener (clicking)
            3 function for event listener bet by ID the three inputs, save as variabls (or use the same one for less code)
            4 build string using value of the input
        5 put the alert with the string inside of the alert
